# DESKREEN CREATOR IS A UKRAINIAN. 🇺🇦 UKRAINE 🇺🇦 NEEDS YOUR HELP ❗️❗️❗️

## [♥️ CLICK HERE TO DONATE TO UKRAINE! ♥️](https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497294840110977024)

If you don't live in a cave and aware of what is going on in the world 🌍 , Russian 🇷🇺 government had started global armed invasion on the territory of Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022. **_This is for real, this is a WAR. Russian army is killing Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian civil citizens and Ukrainian children RIGHT NOW because Russian government gave them an order to do so._** You can search online for thousands of videos of what is going on in Ukraine.

Ukrainians fight brave for their land and will never give up. But you must understand that our country is fighting here not for our land only, but for the safety of the whole world. ❗️❗️❗️ **_If Ukraine fails in this war with Russian army and Russian government, the security of all countries in the world 🌍 will be under the threat! Russian government and it's vicious allies and governments from other countries will be moving their armies to YOUR land, sooner or later_** ❗️❗️❗

You must understand that now Ukraine has more people here willing to fight than weapons, military supplies and other inventory for them.

**If you CAN and WANT to support Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Ukrainian army, here is a tweet with instructions from OFFICIAL ✅ account of Ukraine 🇺🇦**

## Deskreen turns any device with a web browser into a secondary screen for your computer

Deskreen is an `electron.js` based application that uses `WebRTC` to make a live stream of your
desktop to a web browser on any device.
It is built on top of [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate)
For better security mechanism, end-to-end encryption is implemented, which is inspired by
[darkwire.io](https://github.com/darkwire/darkwire.io). The difference is that it is rewritten
in `Typescript` and transformed to use `node-forge` instead of `window.crypto.subtle`.
Why this was made? Because a client served with `http` without SSL, which makes `window.crypto.subtle` unavailable.

## NOTE: We are looking for a solution to get rid from Dummy Display Plugs while using Deskreen as a second screen. Your code support is highly valuable and welcome in Deskreen!

Display Dummy Plugs are good temporary solution, but it is not that good for everyone.
If you are a seasoned Windows or Linux or MacOS hacker with a knowledge of low level tweaks and tricks, you can help us to make Deskreen better!
On a long run Deskreen seeks for getting rid of Display Dummy Plugs, because most people don't like using them. Sometimes they can't use them because all available display ports are already taken.
**So we need to have native drivers for Win / Mac / Linux that will help to enable virtual display without Dummy Display Plugs.**
There are already working commercial solutions out there with their own drivers which they don't disclose, but this task is doable with a help of entire community.
The goal of Deskreen is to enable community power and knowledge to overcome these technical challenges and make it a go-to second screen solution that everyone will benefit from!

We plan on making virtual display driver support for each of three main operating systems and place all OS related codes in **[`./drivers`](drivers)** subdirectory of this project.
You can find brief requirements for driver API in **[`./drivers/README.md`](drivers)**.

Share your valuable knowledge on how to create virtual desktop **without a Dummy Display Plug [in this discussion thread.](https://github.com/mdariel663/deskreen-update/discussions/86)**

Thank you in advance!

## Get Started for Developers

### Run `pnpm test-all` locally to make sure you don't have any errors, before submitting your PR

### Prerequisites

You will need to have `node` `npm` and `yarn` installed
globally on your machine.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1. git clone this repo
2. `cd app/client; yarn install --frozen-lockfile ; cd ../../ ; yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
3. `yarn dev` -- run in dev mode with live updates
=======
1. `git clone this repo`
2. `cd app/client; pnpm install --frozen-lockfile ; cd ../../ ; pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
3. `pnpm dev` -- run in dev mode with live updates
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

### Useful pnpm commands

`pnpm start` -- run in production mode to test, without packaging
`pnpm package` -- to package an app and make executables available in `release` folder

#### for more pnpm commands look at `package.json`

### How to run tests

`pnpm test` -- run all unit tests
`pnpm build-ux && pnpm test-ux` -- run User Experience tests (no tests for `app/client` yet)

### TODO: add e2e tests with host + client app interaction

#### run tests of host app

`pnpm test-watch-not-silent` -- run tests in watch mode with console logs only for host app, excluding `app/client`
`pnpm test -- -u` -- update snapshots

#### run tests for `app/client`

`pnpm test` -- run client tests in watch mode
`test:nowatch` -- run client tests a single time
`pnpm test -- -u` -- update snapshots

### Generate test coverage results

`pnpm coverage` -- when run from project root, generates a coverage report for `host` and `app/client`

### How to regenerate snapshots if you have tests failing when running `pnpm test`?

in root `./` folder of project run this:

```
pnpm jest --updateSnapshot
```

in Deskreen Viewer `./app/client` folder of project run this:

```
cd app/client
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true pnpm test:nowatch -- -u
```

### Run `pnpm test-all` locally to make sure you don't have any errors, before submitting your PR

## Instruction for running a local Sonar Qube, community edition

### Prerequisites

You need to install Sonar Qube community edition for your machine.
And sonar-scanner. Then add sonar scanner to your PATH.

You need to run sonar-scanner separately on root directory
and on `app/client` directory.

Luckily for you sonar scanner is automatically triggered after `husky` checks.
So you only need to install and configure SonarCube locally and
create two separate projects in SonarCube panel.
First project for host app, and second project for client viewer app.
TODO: add how to get started with local SonarCube for Deskreen in details.

### WebRTC Screen Sharing Session Initiation Step by Step

![sharng-session-init](./doc/init-sharing-session/deskreen-webrtc-screen-sharing-session-initiation-pavlobu-22012021.svg)

### Benchmarks:

[Benchmarks can be found here](./doc/benchmarks)

## Note on versioning:

- All versions git tags should start with `v` ex. `v1.0.0`
- Before making a new release with `git push <version-tagname>` set version
  to `<version-tagname>` ! without `v` in the beginning! (ex. `1.0.0` -- not start with `v`) in these three files:
  - `package.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`
  - `app/package.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`
  - `app/package-lock.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`
  - `app/client/package.json` -- in `version` key ex. `1.0.0`
